# Backstory

It is a period of grave danger. The Evil forces, striking from a hidden base, has attacked the rebel army base and destroyed all their battleships. During the battle, most rebel forces managed to flee. However left with no weapons to fight with, there seems to be no hope of destroying the Evil. However, dedicated to defeat them , A young Rebellion leader, Jean sets aboard his Star Cruiser to finally solve the mystery of the lost galaxy of Fabula....

Several legends have been written and said about the mystical Fabula. Some say it can only be visited in the dreams, while some claim that it is so dark that nobody can ever see or find it. Guided by his master's words, one day young Jean discovered a strange source of light and he followed it. The light got brighter and brighter and suddenly he saw a strange new planet. Jean spent several years on the planet and documented everything he could about the strange planet. Here’s what he wrote: 

"I have found a new galaxy but this is not like any other galaxy we’ve ever seen. Perhaps its Fabula that I have found! It seems to be a very small galaxy with only 1000 stars. The planets in Fabula do not rotate around the sun!!! In fact this galaxy does not seem to obey any law of nature as we know it. The stars here emit stardust which is the only natural resource in the entire galaxy. Stardust can be used for anything from building new spaceships to upgrading your battlestation. If anybody finds this note, on the back side I have drawn a map. There are only 4000 such maps and each map will guide you to one of the planets in Fabula.”(edited)
Planets
Every player must have at least one planet to be able to play the game. Planets are where your battlestation and defence base is located. Each planet has its own set of features which determines its value and rarity. In Tatooine everything from size to distance from nearby stars matter because they affect how much stardust the planet can collect from the star. Every planet has a unique set of defences which determine how well it performs against an attack. 

# Stardust

Stardust is the currency of the CryptoSpaceX Universe. Anything you do in the universe be it building new starships, upgrading your assets or attacking another planet, you will need stardust to do so. Stardust can be obtained in two ways—buying from the star owners or attacking and stealing from other planets.

# Stars

Stars continuously emit stardust and are the only source of stardust in the galaxy. Owning a star is extremely rewarding. To receive stardust from a nearby sun, planets have to pay for the duration for which they want to receive stardust. Star owners get to decide the price they want to set for the stardust. The prices will have lower and upper bounds to ensure stable game economics. While users pay for time, the amount of stardust received depends upon the planet’s size and its distance from the star. So choose wisely!
Battle
Stardust is very rare and there is just not enough for everybody. While only the stars can produce stardust, every planet also has its store of stardust and others can attack and steal it. A successful attack results in the opponent losing some of his stardust to you. But winning a battle isn’t as easy as it sounds. You have to defeat the planet defence and also battle against the ships of the opponent planet. 

# Planet Defence

Each planet features a set of unique defence elements like the shield, land droid, plasma cannon, hellfire, laser shock. Players can choose different defensive strategies by changing their defence elements. The shield is one of the coolest defence elements. Any battleship whose level is lower than the planetary shield level, is completely destroyed during an attack. Upgrading any defence element requires that you have already upgraded your planet to the next level. As you upgrade your planets, more defence strategies get unlocked. 

# Battlestation

Each planet has its own battlestation which holds the battleships for the planet. Battleships can be added and removed from the station. Only the ships held in a planet’s battlestation are used during an attack or defending against an attack. Upgrade your battlestation to hold more ships.
Battleships
Stardust can be used to unlock a new battleship. Several battleships can be found all of which have an element of chance. Be extremely lucky and you might receive a Guardian Volkator Battle Cruiser. Battleships can be upgraded using stardust but you can never change their rarity. Each battleship has an assault power and a shield. Battleships stored in a planet’s battlestation are used while attacking another planet and also help in defending against attacks. 

# Explorer Rockets

Other than the 4000 planets found on the maps, Fabula has several other unexplored planets. Explorer rockets can be fired from planets to find new planets. Each rocket has a small chance of finding another planet. Once you’ve found a planet, you can start upgrading its defences and attack or simply sell it on the marketplace. 

# Tournaments and Alliances

Every two weeks the top 32 players battle head to head in a knockout tournament to win the ultimate prize. These players can form alliances with other players(but not amongst themselves) to strengthen their army. Players can either offer their allegiance to one of the top 20 or put their allegiance on sale in the marketplace. The game will also hold special events and tournaments featuring all the players.

# SpaceX Tokens
The SpaceX tokens are sold during the pre sale and are hard capped at 4000. They are a means to reward the early adopters of the game. The tokens acts as a lifetime membership to all game episode releases by CryptoSpaceX. Owners of SpaceX tokens shall receive the new game assets at the launch of each episode. 30% of all revenue generated by stars would be distributed among all token HODLers. 

# The Death Ray

As the name itself suggest, the death ray is the ultimate weapon on the Universe. It can be found at game launch by token holders and has a very small generation chance. No other death ray can ever be made and can only be bought from those who already have one. Being the most powerful spaceship of the CryptoSpaceX universe, the death ray launches a plethora of destruction on any planet. Good luck surviving against it!
